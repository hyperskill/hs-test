# hs-test
It is a framework that simplifies testing educational projects for [Hyperskill](https://hyperskill.org). It is built on top of JUnit.

It is required to use for Hyperskill projects. The main features are:
* black box testing
* multiple types of tests in a simple unified way (without stdin, with stdin, files, Swing, Spring)
* generating learner-friendly feedback (filtering stack-traces, hints)
